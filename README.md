# 2-Player-Button-Reaction-Game-for-Raspberry-Pi
A 2-Player button reaction game that I developed in 2020 using Python for use in Raspberry Pi with 2 buttons and an LED.
Much of the code is designed to work specifically for Raspberry Pi so it will not play on any other microcontroller without some adaptation.
Required modules: gpiozero, random, time
